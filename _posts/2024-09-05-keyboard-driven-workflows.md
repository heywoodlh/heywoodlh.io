Over the past 3-5 years, I've done a lot of work to rely less and less on my mouse. First, I started using the command line almost exclusively for all my tasks. I became (and still am) obsessed with Vim and using Vim-keybindings everywhere. Eventually my condition worsened to the point where I don't even have a mouse at my work or personal machines anymore.

My goal with this post is to document the tools that I use on a daily basis that allow me to abandon my mouse.

A lot of these points have been covered in my post from 2022 [Mouseless workflows on MacOS](https://heywoodlh.io/mouseless-workflows-on-macos), but it's been a bit and I never fully covered the major tooling I use on the Linux side of things.

## Operating System specifics

### Use built-in keyboard shortcuts

This one seems really obvious, but as someone who has been floating around Linux with its offerings of various desktop environments, tiling window managers, etc. it's one that hasn't come very naturally to me. MacOS, Linux and Windows all have very similar, built-in keyboard shortcuts.

### Nix as my cross-platform package manager
