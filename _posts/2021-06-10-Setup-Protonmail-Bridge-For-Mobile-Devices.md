This post will go over setting up a bridge to use Protonmail with other devices that don't have the [official Protonmail Bridge available for them](https://protonmail.com/bridge/). The Protonmail Bridge allows you to get all the benefits of Protonmail with other mail clients. 

I'm writing this because I think Protonmail's mobile client kind of sucks and because [Apple announced some pretty nice privacy features coming in i[Pad]OS 15]() that I would love to take advantage of. Plus, I wouldn't mind having one less app on my phone.
