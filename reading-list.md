My tech reading list generated weekly.
I use [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) to aggregate my feeds in combination with [Reeder5](https://www.reederapp.com/) on mobile.
Using the following GitHub Action to generate this list: [generate-reading-list](https://github.com/heywoodlh/heywoodlh.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/reading-list.yml)
